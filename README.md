> [!IMPORTANT]
> Foundry [only keeps the earliest release of each month](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/d94e3c631e2da7756af46c70f8f58b75563b7013/.github/scripts/prune-prereleases.js#L38). So I don't recommend pinning to any other release.

> [!TIP]
> I use and recommend [`mise`](https://github.com/jdx/mise), a drop-in replacement for `asdf` written in Rust.
